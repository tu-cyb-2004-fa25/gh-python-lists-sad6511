# in-class exercise for Lecture 03 List

# 1. Fill in the missing code to produce the output: ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'kawasaki']
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
#<<insert your missing code here>>
print(motorcycles)


# 2. Please double each element in the list 
my_list = [1, [4, 6, 12], 7, 8]
#<<insert your missing code here>>
print(my_list)

# 3. Fill in the code to produce the following output:  [3, 6, 99, 45, 29, 34] 
#    You can insert multiple lines of code, obtain target_list based on list1 and list2
list1 = [3,6,99,12]
list2 = [64,45,29,34]
#<<Insert your code here>>
target_list = [] # comment out this line 
print(target_list)

# Try it yourself exercise
# 3-8. Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit
# (1) Store the locations in a list

# (2) Print your list in its original order

# (3) Print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list

# (4) Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it

# (5) Change the order of your list in reverse order and print it

# (6) Change your list so it’s stored in reverse-alphabetical order, and print it 


# 4-3. Counting to Twenty: Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive. 

# 4-7. Threes: Make a list of the multiples of 3, from 3 to 30. Use a for loop to print the numbers in your list. 

# 4-8. Cubes: A number raised to the third power is called a cube. For example, the cube of 2 is written as 2**3 in Python. Make a list of the first 10 cubes (that is, the cube of each integer from 1 through 10), and use a for loop to print out the value of each cube. 

# 4-9. Cube Comprehension: Use a list comprehension to generate a list of the first 10 cubes.
